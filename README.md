This is a color preset for the [Tabula Rasa] skin. It's based on the [Spacemodo skin](http://komodoide.com/packages/skins/spacemodo/), which I originally developed quite a while ago, but was never finished.

## Installation and Usage

 * install [Tabula Rasa]
 * Go to Preferences > Appearance
 * Select the "Tabula Rasa" skin and Iconset
 * Hit the "Import" button under "Skin Colors"
 * Select the file you downloaded here and press Ok
 
For best results I've included the Spacemodo color scheme.
